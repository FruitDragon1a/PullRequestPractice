This way please maam a server robot said Follow me The robot rolled ahead of Alex leading her down the runway and to the waiting private jet Our employers will be very happy to have your service on I 329 I still do not know what a tech company wants with a botanist on a remote island Alex remarked absent mindedly hoping for an answer A set of lights on the robots head flashed as an acknowledgement that Alexs comment had been heard but there was no response Ascend these stairs and take your seat please it finally instructed as it rolled to a stop next to the planes staircase Your partner for this assignment is already waiting inside When you both are ready to leave simply let the pilot know Thankyou Alex said The robot was rolling back to the airport before she could finish her sentence Okay then Shrugging she turned to climb the stairs At the top Alex entered the passenger cabin and was stunned by what she saw Having only ever ridden in commercial planes before she was unused to the sheer amount of luxury in the plane Despite being smaller than most commercial planes it was decorated in a way that made it seem just as large as the international flights Even the seats despite having seatbelts like any normal plane were lined up on the sides of the flight to make room for a table in the middle unusual in that it looked less like a plane and more like the posh executive lounge where company bigwigs gathered for catered two hour lunch meetings A slight girl dressed in the companys forest green uniform was seated at the far end of the table playing a game on a gaming console The telltale sound of a typical Game Over screen echoed through the room and the girl dropped her forehead to the table and groaned Uh hi Alex said feeling kind of bad for interrupting whatever was going on with her game I am Alex and I think you are my partner for this assignment The girl looked up startled Oh hi I did not think you would be coming this early I usually arrive a few hours before takeoff just in case I am Priya Then she brushed her hair out of her face and went straight back to her game You can put your backpack in the back theres a storage space she added after a moment likely as an afterthought Alex sighed and followed Priyas instructions dropping her backpack on an empty rack in a closet Then she took a seat near the other girl and buckled in pulling her phone out of her pocket in sheer boredom She opened the eLibrary and clicked on her downloaded books hoping to read one of the books she had been neglecting for a while too focused on studies and work Nooooo Alex heard Priya say ten minutes into the flight Wheres my charger She heard the sound of a seatbelt unbuckling then frantic footsteps and the clatter of items being dropped onto the storage racks Priya came back a moment later chargerless and with a devastated expression Excuse me she said to Alex who looked up from her book do you have a charger She rattled off a bunch of meaningless letters and numbers that Alex figured probably belonged to the type of charger she wanted Uhhh Alex said I have no idea what you are talking about Priya sighed and then elaborated Do you have a standard laptop charger with a wall plug Alex shook her head I do not have a laptop I use a tablet she confessed Priyas eyes widened How do you live like that If I did not have my laptop or desktop to work on I would go crazy Shrugging Alex said That is just what I have always done It works for me Then a thought struck her If you bring your laptop with you everywhere to work on why do not you have a charger I did not bring it this time Priya wailed The company told me that I would be working on one of their desktops so I did not bring it I usually bring the same charger for my laptop and my console but I left the charger at home because I was not bringing the laptop Oh Alex shrugged I am sorry I cannot help you It is fine Priya said shrugging It was my own mistake I suppose Despite her reassuring words as she plopped back in her seat and laid her head on the table Alex could think of only one word to describe her devastated Alex glanced down at her tablet then up at the bored girl sitting across from her Um she said awkwardly holding the tablet out do you want to use my tablet You can download a game on it if you want Priya looked up Really You would let me Yeah Alex shrugged Why not Thank you She watched Priya take the tablet and immediately navigate the app store typing a keyword and downloading the first game that popped up Once Alex was sure Priya was fine she turned to gaze out the window at the ocean over which they were flying Just then the plane gave a slight rattle What was that Huh Priya looked up The plane just shook Priya turned back to the game she was playing on Alexs tablet Probably just turbulence she said dismissively Okay Alex said returning to the view of the outside Then she noticed something unusual Priya we are going down What The girl glanced up from her game again looking a little annoyed What do you mean we are going down We are probably just landing Alex heard the soundtrack of Priyas game resume No I mean it I cannot see the island in front of us but the ocean is getting a lot closer than before As if to prove Alexs words the lights in the cabin suddenly blinked red and an alarm began to blare Oxygen masks dropped down from the overhead Oh no Alex quickly strapped her oxygen mask on then glanced over at Priya who had dropped Alexs tablet on the seat next to her and was frantically buckling her seatbelt Put your oxygen mask on Alex hissed I am trying to hurry sorry Priya said with more than a little sass in her voice She finally managed to get the buckle to click together and pulled on the mask What is going on I do not know Alex replied Just hope for the best Tightly clutching the armrests of her seat she glanced out the window one more time and she squeezed her eyes shut We are about to hit the Alexs eyes blinked open The impact had been loud but thankfully the seatbelts and oxygen masks had saved them from the worst of the force She looked around seeing the cabin of the plane had remained mostly intact albeit with obvious dents Priya was still strapped in but she had hit her head and was unconscious Quickly glancing through the window Alex could see that they had landed in the water and the plane was slowly sinking She quickly unbuckled her seatbelt yanking off the oxygen mask and rushed over to the other passenger Wake up she called out panic leaking through her voice We need to get out of here No response Alex checked for blood None Fumbling she quickly unbuckled Priyas seatbelt as well pulling off her mask and hoisting her petite body across her arms Where are the life jackets she mumbled to herself There have to be life jackets She quickly set Priya down and found some life jackets stashed along the walls of the plane and grabbed them shoving one on Priya before buckling her own and inflating it An inflatable raft was housed in a glass case on the wall which Alex quickly tugged open pulling the rubber mass out and tugging the inflation cord She pushed open the emergency exit then shoved Priya unceremoniously out after it jumping through herself just before the plane started to fill with water Before long the plane was fully submerged leaving the tiny life raft bobbing in the waves Priya was still unconscious leaving Alex desperately paddling as best as she could away from the wreckage with only her hands When the water finally calmed she relaxed and looked around for any sign of land Is that she muttered shading her eyes against the sun Sure enough there was a tall mountain in the distance She began to paddle as fast as she could but they were barely moving in the water She soon decided that it would be better if she got into the water and started kicking and it took only a moment for her to slip into the water and grip onto the back of the raft After a few minutes Alex noticed that her hands were way closer to the water than they had been when she started and her heart sank Pulling herself back in she carefully inspected the edges of the raft Sure enough a thin stream of bubbles was rising from a tiny puncture below the water level They were once again slowly sinking She got back in the water and tried paddling as fast as she could making it as far as possible without falling into the water but soon enough the raft was low enough for water to start seeping in Alex pulled Priya out and treaded water watching the raft finally give in and head straight to the oceans bottom Some of the cold water splashed Priya in the face and she made a strange noise and shook her head slowly opening her eyes What she said Where are we More water splashed on her face and she made a face of disgust Is this salt water Yeah Alex said tiredly We are almost there Just hold on okay She began to kick still moving towards the island from where the mountains she had spotted emerged She refused to take her eyes from it as though clutching it in her sights willed her closer to its shore And safety Despite being much bigger on the horizon it still felt so far beyond reach She scolded herself on the inside They were going to make it Priya sniffed clinging to Alexs back as they moved through the water I wanna go home she wailed I hate the ocean There is nothing we can do about it Priya Alex said kindly although her patience was starting to run thin Can you help me by kicking so we can reach land faster Priya started to kick trying to match Alexs pace but she tired quickly My head hurts she whined Her kicks began to grow weaker as she clung tighter to Alex What was your game about The one on the plane Alex grunted out between breaths of exertion She was trying to distract Priya so her headache would not hinder her Tell me about it It was a turn based RPG from a series of games known as As Priya rambled on about her game her kicks slowly began to grow stronger and the beach ahead started to grow ever closer Almost there The moment Alexs feet touched dry sand she collapsed on the ground and unceremoniously dumped Priya off her shoulder We made it I am never moving from here Owwww Every muscle in Alexs body was burning Priya slowly sat up drenched in seawater and caked in sand Where are we Dunno What are the chances that we ended up where we were supposed to go Priya thought for a moment her brow furrowing Pretty likely she finally said If we ended up on Paradise Lost Sorry what is Paradise Lost Oh it is I 329 All the researchers on the island call it Paradise Lost because that was what the original owner called it and it really does look like a paradise The lost part is because of all the knowledge that was lost in the ruins that were overgrown here Oh yeah also there was a book called Paradise Lost written a long time ago and apparently the previous owner of this island was quite a connoisseur of books Okay So the odds that we ended up on Magic Paradise Island are pretty high Do you think we can find the research base where we were supposed to land It is Paradise Lost not Magic Paradise Island Priya corrected And wherever we are it is nowhere near a research center You can see down the beach for miles Alex followed Priyas gaze Could the research center be in the middle of the island she asked Maybe Priya replied The surface area of this island is mostly covered in dense forest though If we are going to find a research center anywhere around here it will be purely by chance Do you not know where it is Why would I know where it is Alex shrugged You seem like you actually read the guide they sent for the assignment so I figured you knew everything about this place They did not mention the location of the research center Priya said defensively Why would they mention that I dunno I did not read the guide Alex replied Priya shrugged Well do you know how to survive on an abandoned island in the MIDDLE OF NOWHERE You seem stressed Alex said pointing out the obvious Priyas eye twitched Of course I am stressed All my stuff is at the bottom of the ocean there is no way for either of us to look for help and I have almost no survival skills two years of Girl Scouts does not teach anyone to survive in the middle of a random island So Do you know how to survive on an abandoned island Alex shrugged I guess I mean I know how to find edible plants Does that help OF COURSE IT DOES Woah okay Alex said trying to placate Priya I get it we are in a really bad situation But yelling at each other and pushing each other away is not going to help Why do not we both take a step back I will go look for something to eat in the nearby bushes and you can try and make us a shelter here on the beach Fine Priya stormed off and knelt by the woods trying to pull a giant branch onto the beach Alex watched her for a moment then walked over to the border of the forest inspecting the plants She grabbed some loose fibrous bark from a tree then continued her search It did not take her long to find a few edible roots which she brought back along with a large leaf to use as a tray so the roots would not get sandy By the time Alex returned Priya had finished dragging a bunch of wood onto the beach and was standing over the heap surveying the collection Feeling better Alex asked Priya nodded Sorry for blowing up at you she said It is fine Can I snap some of the smaller twigs off of those branches Priya stepped back Be my guest As Alex worked Priya watched her curiously What are you doing I am starting a fire Alex replied arranging the sticks in a cone shape She dug around in her pocket hoping to find the Swiss Army knife she kept with her at all times After a false alarm of thinking it had fallen into the ocean she checked her other pocket and it was right where she left it Thank goodness I did not lose this she said out loud Lose what Priya had returned to the shelter she was trying to build My pocketknife It has a magnifying glass in it and I think I can start a fire with this She unfolded the tool in question and held it out placing the tree bark tinder in the center of her stick pyramid Now if I can just remember how to do this She tilted the magnifying glass and a bright spot of light appeared on the ground She kept angling it until the dot was no more than a quarter inch wide Now we wait she said That is it Priya asked Alex nodded That is it It took a few minutes of Alex holding the magnifying glass over the makeshift firepit but the tinder finally managed to start smoking Yes she said gently coaxing the fire to life by blowing on it and feeding it more tinder I did it Cool can you help me out here now Priya asked holding the branches upright as she tried to construct a lean to After making sure the fire was stable Alex went over and held up the support structure as Priya leaned several more branches on it I can think of several ways to improve this Priya said once they were done but it is good enough for now Alex stepped back and surveyed their makeshift camp A small fire a leaf with food piled on it and the frame for a lean to This is good now what Priya coughed Water Oh yeah Water Alex could not believe she had forgotten water So where do we look If we boil seawater then we could create a makeshift filtration system to get rid of all the salt Priya said thoughtfully It is getting too dark to go looking for an alternative source of water like a pond or a stream There has got to be one nearby though Alex pointed out Unless it rains a lot here and the plants that need fresh water get their water that way there is probably a water source nearby Maybe we can look for it tomorrow Priya conceded But we definitely should not separate We do not know this place well enough yet Alex picked up several sticks from the pile of extra fuel and stripped the bark from them with her knife You are not allergic to anything are you she asked Just making sure No I am not Alex nodded skewering the roots she had foraged then setting up a small spit and placing the skewer on top We have got to rotate this pretty regularly so it roasts evenly They sat by the fire for a few minutes as Alex rotated the spit Priya brushed fruitlessly at the sand that had stuck to her clothes during their impromptu swim for survival I am so bored she finally said groaning There is nothing to do and my console fell into the ocean Ughhh You could try stargazing Alex suggested Apparently places here in the middle of nowhere do not have light pollution She took her own suggestion and glanced up gasping in shock Wow that is a lot of stars Stars More stars than Alex had ever seen in her life There were so many It made her feel small like she was just a tiny dot in a universe teeming with It was beautiful and if Alex had the words for it she would try her best to describe it But she did not She could not So she just sat there and took it all in feeling lucky to have lived long enough to see this Alex glanced over at Priya who was staring at the sky with her mouth wide open Wow Just wow They sat in silence for a moment before Alex pulled the roasted food out of the makeshift spit Here she said handing Priya one of the skewers I will make more if you are still hungry Priya took it gratefully and pulled off a piece putting it in her mouth What do we do she said voice muffled What do you mean Priya swallowed I mean what do we do about this she gestured wildly All of this How do we get off this island Maybe we could find the people we are supposed to meet with Alex offered Like the base we were supposed to work at But what if this is not the right island Alex scratched her head Uh How about we cross that bridge when we come to it For now let us see if we are on the right island So are you suggesting we explore the island After thinking for a moment Alex nodded Yeah I guess I am suggesting that What do you say I guess we could Priya said Tomorrow though It is getting pretty late Tomorrow Woah Priya breathed gazing at the overgrown cave opening in the mountain This is so cool Can we go in You want to go in In the dark spooky cave Did I mention the dark spooky cave Okay sure You first I will follow maybe Okay come on it is not that spooky It just has stalactites and stalagmites Normal cave stuff Alex shuddered But what if there is some huge animal living in there Like last time Last time was a fluke Priya protested It is not like we knew there was a giant insert tropical animal in that den Alex gave her an unimpressed look Yeah Just like we do not know this time Please Alex Priya gave Alex her best attempt at puppy dog eyes Come on Alex said You made that face last time too Yeah and it worked did not it Alex sighed Yeah I guess it did Fine She lifted the heavy stick she had sharpened with her pocketknife You still go first though Gladly Turning Priya skipped into the cave a huge grin on her face After a moment Alex hesitantly followed stepping carefully around the hanging stalactites in the cave She could see Priya in the distance but soon the cave grew too dark Priya Where are you Over here came a distant response echoing slightly That does not help she called back Alex heard shuffling and then footsteps growing closer A moment later Priya emerged Here See What is down there Alex asked Just a huge underground lake that is all Priya said Boring stuff Boring is probably good you know Alex said Less danger that way Besides we can collect water from the lake instead of the small stream we found Then we will have access to more It is still boring you can not convince me otherwise Priya said sniffing She walked past Alex to leave the cave Alex shrugged and followed after her By now she was used to Priyas somewhat capricious nature So where to next she asked Priya once they were both standing in the dappled sunlight of the forest outside You had a list of places you wanted to investigate just from catching a glimpse of them from the beach So I remember seeing a strange shadow on the mountain a little bit that way Priya said pointing in the direction of the midmorning sun Okay Lead the way Priya took the stick from Alex and started shoving aside vines and branches They walked for a while long enough for Alexs stomach to start growling from hunger She glanced around spotting one of the abundant wild ambarella bushes filled with yellow green fruit Are you hungry yet she asked Priya Priya stopped for a moment then hesitantly nodded Yeah I am But I kinda wanted to keep going We should eat Alex insisted We have food here She plucked one of the ambarellas and handed it to Priya who used her thumbnail to peel it This ruin has a computer in it And it still works I think I can get inside and figure out what it was used for Priya immediately set to work typing away on the keyboard and grinning widely Then her grin faltered There is there is a passcode It it is eight characters, and I do not know enough about the systems programming to hack it This computer is too old for that Her hands were shaking I failed she said Alex shook her head It is not over until it is over she reminded Priya There has got to be a way to get that password Did you check under the console Priya obliged Nothing Alex took another look around the room The walls and floor were built of stone although they were all cracked and overrun with vines and flora now Then a thought struck her Maybe this is why they called on a botanist for this mission What You see we are in a room completely covered in plants What if that is by design Maybe it is some kind of puzzle Like in your games Hmmm I do not get it Alex sighed Just watch She knelt down by one of the plants near the console a vine with bright purple flowers Nope Continuing down the line she stopped by another vine this one with red tipped leaves Priya pocketknife please You have it Priya reminded her Oh right Alex pulled the pocketknife from her pocket and made a tiny incision in the base of the stem She pushed the knife down further opening the cut Green sap oozed over her fingers What are you doing Priya said at Alexs shoulder startling her so badly she nearly flung the pocketknife across the room Well this plant has a special property It has a tiny hollow in its stem really close to the base of the plant If you leave something in the plant while it is growing when it reaches maturity that object will be fully encased in the stem and the only way to get it out is to excise it So that is what I am doing Sure enough a moment after she stuck her fingers in the gap Alex pulled out a tiny capsule She handed it to Priya So uh you wanna do the honors She brandished her hands as an example
