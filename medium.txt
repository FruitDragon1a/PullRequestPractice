Ughh my head The world swam into view gray coating my vision I blinked trying to clear it when the overwhelming stench of sulfur and ash filled my nostrils Huh Where am I I tried not to breathe in through my nose my eyes began to sting from the dust hovering everywhere as I looked around I was sitting in my living room I slowly got to my paws tucking my wings securely along my back Mom Dad Evaly Jared I called looking for even one member of my family Where are you What happened here I leapt down from the burnt mass I was standing on sneezing as dust and ash billowed in a cloud where my paws landed I caught a glimpse of a half burned mass of melted glass a pretty blue color that was now mixed with copious amounts of gray I recognized that color My sister Evaly had brought the sculpture home from school several weeks ago and my brother had insisted we keep it on the table in clear view for everyone to admire the fish shapes within Those same fish shapes were gone now melted into nothingness My confusion started to clear as I realized what must have happened replaced instead by dread and fear I called louder now scared and insistent Mom Evaly Why is our living room burned Where are you Unconsciously I moved my wing to rub at my face the scales coming into contact with the cool hardness of the orange topaz in my forehead A sure sign that I was still alive and not dreaming as much as I wished this was all a horrible nightmare If only the gems in dragon winged cat foreheads manifested in our dreams Suddenly my legs flew out from under me as I tripped on something hard and round My face slammed into the floor unsettling a layer of ash several inches deep and sending most of it billowing into the air coating my fur and causing me to squeeze my eyes shut I silently counted to ten before forcing my eyes open again dread filling me as I searched for the object I tripped on I carefully patted the residual ash until I felt it then gently dug through the dust to pick it up The moment I saw the telltale orange luster I dropped the gem and choked back a sob Mom I yelled squeezing my eyes shut Where are you Please tell me you are okay Please tell me that is not your gem No response Pleaseâ€“ please tell me you are not gone Please My pleas fell into a whimper as tears began to sting my eyes I did not know how long I sat there crumpled in disbelief before I gathered enough courage to stop crying and open my eyes My mother seven pointed star shaped gem twinkled cheerfully on the ash the orange topaz much like my own in stark contrast to the monotonous gray around it It took me several minutes to gather myself but I finally scooped up the gem and nestled it gently in my pouch before leaving the remains of what was once our living room I was determined to find out what happened no matter what Everywhere I turned I smelled and tasted ash It did not take long for me to figure out that what happened to our house was not an isolated incident One look at my surroundings the moment I stepped out and I immediately realized we had not been the only ones Hulking burned shapes loomed where walls once proudly stood ash gently floating through the air the telltale glow of actual fires still burning somewhere in the distance I could not see a thing beyond that but that was all I needed The air was stifling and heavy with heat so that my fur was starting to clump together with the sticky ash Dazed and lost I picked a random direction and started moving forward looking for some way out of this nightmarish world I passed dozens of gems as I trudged onward as though the cats they had belonged to had tried to escape and failed Picking up each one I found I tucked the jewels into my pouch intending to honor those cats properly I finally gave up and spread my wings intending to fly as far as I could I managed to fly high enough that I felt more alert with less ash and smoke choking the air I got far enough away from the smoke to see still leafy trees far ahead before my wings gave out and I crashed into the ground a cloud of ash billowing up around me Struggling to my feet I slowly started putting one paw in front of the other desperate to make it to shelter I wheezed and my lungs ached at the sheer amount of dust and ash I had inhaled No doubt I would be coughing it up for weeks Finally I spotted a small hollow at the base of one of the trees I had glimpsed It looked to have been abandoned in a hurry with scratches on the visible roots and a few nuts still left inside I crawled in glad I was still small enough to fit and rested my wings over my head to block the entrance before sinking into a deep sleep Much later I awoke with no idea of how much time had passed The air had mostly cleared around my little tree hollow giving me a clear glimpse of the rising sun outside I struggled to my feet and climbed out of the den taking in the scene around me and the pale sticky ash littering the ground and the treetops I winced at the taste of smoke coughing flecks of ash out of my mouth Groaning pain hit my stomach as I realized just how hungry and thirsty I was First I needed water I had no idea where to find any though The only water source near my colony had to have been contaminated with ash by now considering it had been bordering the northern side of the colony whatever happened would have affected it as well due to its proximity I suddenly felt a splash of something cool on the scruff of my neck Confused I glanced up to see dark gray smoke gathering overhead Unexpectedly I caught a glimpse of an intense flash of white deep in the smoke Maybe it was not smoke after all but storm clouds A moment later a deep growling sound echoed all around me startling me into diving back for cover in the hollow I had slept in I cautiously stuck my head out after a minute passed and saw no large animals around now realizing that must have been the thunder that accompanied lightning everywhere It only served for more confirmation that I was in the middle of a thunderstorm Unsure of what to do now I stepped cautiously out again I needed water desperately but I was nervous about what being in such an open area could mean The trees were still sparse here providing plenty of room for the lightning to strike I needed better cover than a small hollow could provide and fast In that instant another flash of lightning illuminated a copse of densely canopied trees off in the distance As soon as I saw it I started running towards it hoping to make it before anything bad could happen It did not take long to reach it and take it in closer up I spotted a comfortable place to rest higher up in one of the trees and immediately dug my claws into the bark and started to climb up I finally made it to the branch I had seen and ducked into a far more spacious hollow inside the tree trunk I huddled inside waiting for the worst of the storm to pass so I could gather water somehow It did not take long before I dozed off my body finally giving way to more exhaustion I woke up squinting from a very bright light As my eyes adjusted I realized it was the sunlight filtering through the trees into the entrance of my hollow Stepping outside onto the branch I took in the still wet leaves and branches around me when something sparkling caught the corner of my eyes I turned and my jaw dropped with shock A natural depression in the tree branches had grown into a watertight bowl a bowl that was now completely full to the brim with sparkling rainwater I sat for a moment flabbergasted then sprang into action I immediately took a long drink of water the cool liquid sliding down my throat and refreshing me immensely After my thirst was somewhat quenched I glanced around for a tree with broad flat leaves that I could place on top to prevent evaporation Finally glimpsing a low hanging vine with the leaves I needed I crept along the branch and nearly stepped into another one of those bowls Surprised I took a moment to look around the trees I now called home and spotted more and more bowls Thank goodness I had spotted these trees now I had ample supplies of clean drinking water provided I made sure none of it evaporated or was wasted I hopped down from branch to branch and took off a few feet from the ground plucking as many of the flat leaves as I could Then I climbed back into the tree and started methodically placing the leaves atop each depression weaving the long stems together and around the branches to prevent them from falling I made several of these trips finally finishing what felt like several hours later when the sun started to hit its peak My stomach growled and all the hard work I had just done finally caught up to me I needed some food and fast Glancing around at the nearby foliage I hoped that I would see something edible because I was really hungry It did not take long before I found a patch of blackberry bushes hugging a cliff the vines creeping up the face and gathering in the cracks I hungrily reached out to a clump of the dark fruit but the thorns pricked my paws and I hissed with pain Careful I thought to myself as I surveyed it looking for a better target I finally saw a cluster having peeled off of the cliff face and carefully plucked the berries off before popping them into my mouth The sweet tart flavor filled my mouth and I had to restrain myself from immediately grabbing for more Picking the berries off the vine and popping them into my mouth one by one I soon filled my belly I then carefully retraced my steps back to my tree hollow so I could find the blackberries again later Committing the path to memory I then set about trying to find the
