Sire we have arrived not long before nightfall I will wait here for you to finish your business before we head back to your manor The voice of the carriage driver startled the nobleman out of his thoughts He opened the door and took in the scenery disgust radiating from him as he delicately stepped down onto the weathered stained cobblestones of the street He wrinkled his nose at the dead fish piled in barrels currently being unloaded from trawlers docked in the harbor the stench choking the salt tinged air and making his head spin Seagulls circled above screeching and occasionally diving only to soar back up clenching a morsel of food between their sharp beaks Shifty eyed folk ambling around the docks caused the nobleman to push his pouch of gold further into his belt the silken fabric of his clothing catching the eyes of conspirators lurking in the shadows The nobleman rarely took up a pace slower than a jog too afraid of being pickpocketed to appreciate the sight of the setting sun over the shimmering Endless Sea or the dozens of merchant ships with colorful sails and exotic goods docked in the harbor The chatter of local shop owners and foreign sailors haggling over prices filled the air Ahead of him a pockmarked tavern door swung open and a pair of hands roughly shoved a sailor onto the cobblestones lining the street his eyes glazed over The drunken sailor dragged himself off the street and stumbled toward the docks while bellowing a rowdy drinking song seemingly unaware that one of his shoes was missing All the while the nobleman hurried onward avoiding the crowds After nearly running straight past the nobleman backtracked and headed into a narrow alley between two dusty storefronts scanning the doors set into the walls for the one he was looking for The path briefly widened and a pair of potion brewers leered at him over the bubbling acid green liquid they were stirring The nobleman shuddered and skirted past as fast as he could heaving a sigh of relief when the alley narrowed again His fine tunic caught on a rusty nail as he swept past ripping before he could do anything about it He cursed and quickly freed himself tucking his velvety jacket further around himself to cover the tear Where is it I could have sworn this was the right street the nobleman muttered to himself pulling a slip of thin parchment from his belt pocket and reading the address hastily scrawled on it He swore when he realized he had accidentally gone down the wrong alleyway Suddenly a shadow darted past on the edge of his vision further down the alley A shiver ran down his spine hello he managed to stammer out then tried again Hello Is anyone there Resting a trembling hand on the jeweled hilt of his knife he slowly slipped it out from its sheath and held it in front of him waiting A minute passed with no response and he could not see anybody no matter which way he looked Relaxing he slid his knife back into the sheath and turned around to return to the mouth of the alleyway Now theres your mistake a raspy voice echoed behind him The nobleman jumped and whirled around in a panic drawing his knife again Where a moment ago there had been only an empty alley now there was a cloaked figure tossing a bag of gold from hand to hand The nobleman immediately patted his pockets and gasped when he realized his money was missing You let go of your guard Heres a free tip never ever relax in the middle of Dunracts alleys they are full of cutthroats conmen and oh what do you know thieves The nobleman growled and lunged forward with a roar only to come to an abrupt halt as the thief grinned maniacally and so fast the nobleman could not see until it was too late knocked the knife out of his hand and pressed their own blade against the nobles heaving throat Stop the nobleman managed to groan despite the knife at his throat That gold does not belong to you Give it back Stepping back the thief glanced at the pouch of gold coins in their other hand Do you rich folk not know what the word thief means We do not take what belongs to us and we certainly do not give it back I know you do not know who I am but I assure you Im very important The thief looked him in the eye amused do not I Nobleman Garen Jameson Lord of Jameson Estate and my fellow thief Strange that you do not know what a thief is What are you talking about Im no thief I do not know where you got your information from but its very clearly wrong Is it The thief tossed the pouch of gold in the air and caught it You say this gold belongs to you However this gold actually belongs to the villagers of Nurwith Valley where you govern You overtax them and keep your lands cut off from the capital so the villagers do not know the actual crown sanctioned tax rates then you send the portion meant for the queen to the castle so no one asks questions and keep the rest of the gold for yourself If that is not thieving what is The nobleman stilled cold sweat dripping down his neck How do you know that What else do you know The thief smirked Youd be surprised at what else I know I know what you are doing in these shady alleys and its against the queens best interests Im sure After all why would she want a potent poison that leaves no trace Those are your own words I read the note you sent to the apothecary including the price Something that I imagine is bundled all neatly in this tiny bag here The thief dangled it invitingly in front of the nobleman He sputtered What do you want from me Money Land Nothing much Ill let you leave in exchange for this bag of shiny gold coins and a promise that you will tax your people by the crown sanctioned amount No more no less It would be a pity for them to find out from someone else that you have been taxing them too much on purpose after all And you will abandon your efforts to assassinate you know who or the queen might just find an anonymous note on her desk detailing for her the dealings of a certain nobleman named Jameson of Jameson Estate Are we clear Clear as crystal the nobleman said fear rushing through his veins at the barely veiled threats Oh if you tell anyone of this encounter I wont need to mention any of your exploits to anyone You will have done that all by yourself You are not supposed to be here so far away from your cozy Nurwith Valley manor in the shady back alleys of Port Dunract looking for an apothecary Are you The thief stepped further back into the shadows their knife already hidden in the folds of their cloak The nobleman shaking in his boots finally fled Turning and whistling a merry tune the thief disappeared into the setting sun
